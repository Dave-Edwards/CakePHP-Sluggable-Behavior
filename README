This is a behavior for CakePHP models. It makes it possible to generate unique URL slugs to be used in permalinks on CakePHP applications. This has been shown to help with search engine optimisation, getting important keywords and phrases into your site URLs.

Go from this:
http://example.com/posts/view/23

To this:
http://example.com/posts/view/great-new-widget-product-released


Quick overview:

* Specify a database field from which the slug should be generated (e.g. headline : 'The Great & the Good')

* Specify a field into which the slug should be stored when new records are created (e.g. url_slug : 'the_great_the_good'). Default is the CakePHP model's displayField

* Specify a slug word separator (defaults to using underscores)

* Automatically handles potential duplicates, and adds numerical suffixes accordingly

* Keeps slugs constant even when source field changes (for true permalinks, unlike the dynamic examples out there)

* Allows slug to be set manually instead of auto-generating it

* Optionally allows an existing slug to be over-written if the title field has changed
